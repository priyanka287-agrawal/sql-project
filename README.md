‚ö° How It Works

Database Setup

When you run the program, it first asks for your MySQL host, username, and password.
It automatically creates a database named IRCTC and sets up the required tables if they don‚Äôt exist.

User Management

New users can create an account by entering details like name, gender, age, DOB, and phone number.
A unique user ID is generated automatically and stored in the database.
Existing users can log in using their user ID and password.

Ticket Booking

After login, the user can book tickets by providing the train name, journey date, from station, and to station.
The system automatically generates a 10-digit PNR number for each booking and saves the details in the database.

View Tickets

Users can view all the tickets they have booked, along with details like PNR, train name, journey date, and route.

PNR Status (Live)

* Users can check the live status of any PNR.
* The system sends a request to the RapidAPI IRCTC PNR Status API, retrieves the current status, and displays information such as:
* Train name and date of journey
* Chart preparation status
* Booking and current status of each passenger

Logout
Users can log out anytime and safely end their session.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Make sure MySQL server is running on your machine.
Clone or download this repository to your local system.
Open a terminal inside the project folder.
Run the script:

python railway\ management\ database.py

Enter your MySQL credentials and start using the system.

üåê API Integration

The project uses RapidAPI to fetch live PNR Status.

You must insert your RapidAPI key in the code:

"X-RapidAPI-Key":"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual API key
